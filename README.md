# R_to_Python_from_Market_Segmentation_Analysis
This is an attempt to convert the code in R to Python. The complete code can be found in the Appendix A of this book in the link below. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SIEt4Bp_4R9dcs4saU1DIui1IKWQIW38/view?usp=sharing
This is book called "Market Segmentation Analysis" by Sarah Dolnicar, Bettina Gr√ºn and Friedrich Leisch. No doubt the whole code is not converted in to Python. Any suggestions are welcome.
